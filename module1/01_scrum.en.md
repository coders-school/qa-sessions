## Scrum - good practices

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Daily meetings - organized to synchronize workflow, see how the work is going and in particular who needs a helping hand because he is stuck.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Iterative approach - we deliver small bits of functionality. It is important to provide anything as soon as possible that causes even only one test to pass. Then everyone can build new functionalities on it.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Retrospectives - the most important meeting in my opinion. It takes place after the iteration (sprint) is completed and the team pats their backs about how great it was, how much has been done and how it can be improved. In addition, the team throws in the worst epithets about the inability to cooperate, not making it on time and not planing its work correctly. After this meeting, conclusions must be formulated, what can be improved for better cooperation and actions to be done for each person.
